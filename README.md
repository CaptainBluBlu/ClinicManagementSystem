# Clinic Management System

This project was created with VB.net for my assignment in semester 3 in my diploma.
It is not very polish because I was just beginning to learn how to program code other than html, css, and javascript :grin:


Thanks to [@wooneusean](https://www.github.com/wooneusean) for helping me with linking sqlite database for the project
